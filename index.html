                    Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (1897-1945) was one of India's most dynamic and courageous freedom fighters, whose leadership inspired millions in the struggle for independence. Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, he was the ninth child in a family of fourteen siblings. A brilliant student, Bose graduated with honors in Philosophy from the University of Calcutta and later went to England to appear for the Indian Civil Service (ICS) exams. Despite excelling in the ICS, he resigned to dedicate his life to the cause of India's freedom.
                    Bose's radical approach distinguished him from the more moderate leaders of the Indian National Congress. He believed in complete independence rather than dominion status for India. Elected twice as Congress President, he resigned in 1939 due to ideological differences with Mahatma Gandhi. Bose then formed the Forward Bloc, aiming to consolidate anti-British forces.
                    During World War II, he sought international alliances, traveling to Germany and Japan to garner support for India's liberation. He famously formed the Indian National Army (INA) with the slogan “Chalo Dilli” (March to Delhi), aiming to overthrow British rule through armed struggle. His leadership and the INA's campaigns in Southeast Asia became legendary.
                    The mystery surrounding Bose's alleged death in a plane crash in 1945 has fueled intrigue for decades, making him a larger-than-life figure in Indian history. Known for his fiery patriotism, he envisioned a free, united, and progressive India.
                    Netaji's legacy lives on as a symbol of bravery, resilience, and uncompromising dedication to the nation. His life continues to inspire generations to stand for justice and work tirelessly for a better future.
                    "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom!"—his iconic words remain etched in the hearts of millions.

                <p>
                    During World War II, Germans and Japanese forces (Axis Powers) were against Britishers. Bose saw an opportunity and asked for help. Germans refused. Japanese forces anyway wanted to attack the British forces so they were ready to help Netaji out. They played smartly and instead of sending their own men, they put forward the Indian soldiers who were fighting for Britishers and were caught during Battle of Singapore. This army unit completely lost their motivation and believed that they were mere scapegoats and were being used for the greed of power. But as soon as Bose took control of this force every thing changed. He called this army unit आज़ाद हिन्द फौज - <b>The Indian National Army (INA)</b>. He motivated them, established a purpose for them that is to free India from Britishraj through his speeches. One of his famous slogan includes “तुम मुझे खून दो, मैं तुम्हे आज़ादी दूंगा।”. Bose also formed an All Women Regiment - रानी झाँसी रेजिमेंट <b>(Rani-Jhansi Regiment)</b> and handed over the command of INA to three incredible commanders Shah Nawaz, Dhillon, Sahgal. These 3 took INA from Singapore to Impal were they encountered British Army which was full of Indian Soldiers. But unfortunately British army ruthlessly defeated INA and in May, 1945 INA surrendered.

                <p>
                    In 1956, the former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee in a conversation with Governor of Bengal said that the role played by Netaji's army was paramount in India being granted Independence, while the role played by the Non-Violent movement was minimal. 
                     And this one statement itself is enough to question the version of history taught in our school textbooks. 
                    Upcoming generations must be taught about INA and their significant contribution to India's Independence. Bose's legacy must continue to inspire the younger generation to strive for a better India.
